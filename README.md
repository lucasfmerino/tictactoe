# How to Play
* The game is played on a 3x3 board.
* One player chooses "X" and the other chooses "O".
* The "X" player always goes first.
* Players take turns making moves by placing one of their symbols in an empty space on the * board.
* The objective of the game is to place three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
